# MOTOR SIZING
## Governing Equations
Force(F) = mass(m) x acceleration due to gravity(g)

F = M(Mass of motor and crusher) X 9.8

Mass of the Crusher = Volume x Density
Mass of the Crusher = Area X Height X Density





Mass of rods of the crusher = Volume x Density
Mass of rods of the crusher = Area X Height X Density
***
Rods used = 2

Density of Steel = 7.85 * 10^-6 Kg mm^-3

Mass of rods = 2 * Volume * Density

Mass of rods = 2 * 47100 mm^3 * 7.85 * 10^-6 Kg mm^-3

Mass of rods = 0.739 kg
***
Mass of the motor = Volume x Density
Mass of the motor = Area X Height X Density

Motors used = 2

Density of Nickel-Chromium Alloy = 8.65 * 10^-6 Kg mm^-3

Mass of motors = 2 * Volume * Density
Mass of motors = 2 * 21195 mm^3 * 8.65 * 10^-6 kg mm^-3

Mass of the motor = 0.370 kg
***
Force = Mass X 9.8
    
F = (0.739 + 0.370) * 9.8

Force = 10.8 N
***
Torque = Force X perpendicular distance
(D=10cm)

Torque = F * D/2     
Torque = 10.8 * 0.05
Torque = 0.54 Nm
***
(N=60 rpm)

Power = 2 Ï€ N Torque/60

Power = 2 * 3.14 * 0.54 * 60 / 60

Power = 3.3912 Watt

***
# ADAPTER SELECTION

From the specifications, load current for 60 rpm DC motor is 300 mA at 12V

Number of DC motor used = 2

Current required = 2 * 300 mA = 600 mA
  
| Other components | Load current at 5V |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| LCD | 50 mA |
| LED | 3 * 20 mA |
| Arduino Uno R3 | 200 mA |
| PIR Sensor | 0.025 mA |
| Buzzer | 5 mA | 

Factor of safety, FOS = 1.2

Total current at 12V = 600 mA * 1.2 = 720 mA

Total current at 5V = 315 mA * 1.2 = 378 mA

Hence, the adapter of 12V 1.5A will be suitable for our design.
