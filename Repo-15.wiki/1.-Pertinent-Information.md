# PAPER CUP
A paper cup is a disposable cup made out of paper and often lined or coated with plastic or wax to prevent liquid from leaking out or soaking through the paper. It may be made of recycled paper and is widely used around the world.

# CRUSHERS
Crushers or rock crushers are machines used to reduce the size of rocks and stones in aggregates production, construction material recycling applications, and in mining operations. Every crushing plant and crushing process has its own requirements and demands. Metso has designed, engineered and manufactured crushers for more than 100 years. Our offering covers different jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, cone crushers, and impact crushers â€“ optimized for any size reduction need. Many of the crushers are available not just as stationary units but also as portable and mobile versions.

# CRUSHER TYPES
### Primary gyratory crushers
Higher throughput and reduced downtime for maximum efficiency 

## Jaw Crushers
Jaw crushers are mainly used as primary crushers. Their main purpose is to reduce rocks to smaller sizes for the next crushing stages. Jaw crushers are a popular alternative to primary gyratory crushers, since they can process large amounts of hard material efficiently. Due to their smaller physical size, jaw crushers are also ideal for tight spaces, such as underground mining and mobile crushing applications.

## Cone Crushers
Cone crushers are popular rock crushing machines in aggregates production, mining operations, and recycling applications. They are normally used in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary crushing stages. Sometimes, however, the grain size of the processed material is small enough by nature and the traditional primary crushing stage is not needed. In these cases, also cone crushers can carry out the first stage of the crushing process.

## Impact Crushers
Impact crushers are utilized in aggregates production, mining operations, as well as in recycling applications. Depending on the type of an impact crusher, they are known for either high reduction ratios or capabilities to produce precisely shaped, cubical end products. Impact crushers can be used in all different stages of size reduction from primary crushing to the last step of the crushing process.
