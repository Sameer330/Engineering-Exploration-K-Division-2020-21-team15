## SYSTEM INTERACTIONS
1. Material : There is a change in the state from one subsystem to another.
2. Energy : Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the process of crushing of cups.
3. Spatial interaction : Geometrical dimensions proper working and tolerance to different conditions.
4. Data : Transfer of signals. Display the number of cups crushed, alert the user and display on/off status.
