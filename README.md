# Engineering-Exploration-K-Division-2020-21-team15
This is a clone of a course project I was a part of. Since the repository was made as 'read-only' by my course teacher, instead of forking it I have cloned it and uploading my progress here. I was the team leader in this project and worked 3 other classmates on this project. Since the course was conducted via 'online mode', we were not able to actually build a machine due to covid restrictions. But we made a 3D working model of our project.

The Original Repository can be found here: https://github.com/K-Division-2020-21-Even/Repo-15/wiki

You can meet my team mates here: https://github.com/orgs/K-Division-2020-21-Even/teams/team15/members

YOU ARE FREE TO USE WHOLE OR PARTS OF THIS PROJECT. IF YOU THINK THESE FILES ARE NOT CLEAR TO READ, HEAD TO THE ORIGINAL REPOSITORY(IT'S MUCH CLEAR AND ORGANISED THERE).
